# Soulbox

Welcome to **Soulbox**! A collection of random, fun, and learning projects that I’m building for fun and personal growth. The goal of this repository is to explore new ideas, experiment with different technologies, and create tools that help with everyday tasks and coding challenges.

## Projects

A. **Python to EXE Converter**  
   This app allows you to easily convert Python `.py` files into standalone `.exe` executables using `PyInstaller`. With a user-friendly interface built using `tkinter`, you can select your Python script, press a button, and get an executable file ready for distribution.


## Upcoming Projects

I will be expanding this repository with more random, fun, and useful tools. Keep an eye out for new additions in the future! <br><br>

## Getting Started

To run these projects locally, you need Python installed on your machine. Here’s how you can get started: <br><br>

### Prerequisites (For Running Locally OR Use the EXE file to Run):

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **PyInstaller** (for Python to EXE Converter)

  To install PyInstaller, you can use pip:
  ```bash
  pip install pyinstaller
  ```

  <br>

### How to Use

- **Python to EXE Converter**:
  Locate and Set the Tkinter Folder (First Time Use Only - It will save the location for next use)
  Select a Python file with Browse Button
  Press the “Convert to EXE” button, and the script will generate an `.exe` file in the same directory as the Python file
